## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.io//) - Angular
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework
- [Restcountries Api](https://restcountries.com/) - Get information about countries via a RESTful API

### What I learned

Through this project I attained a better understanding of RxJs and Observables, [Using TailwindCSS with Angular](https://dev.to/edoriatiri/using-tailwind-30-with-angular-13-3cg9), troubleshooting errors and thinking programmatically - I was able to use memoization to [cache http responses from the Restcountries api using the shareReplay RxJS operator](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-create-a-caching-service-for-angular-bfad6cbe82b0) amongst many other valuable things.
